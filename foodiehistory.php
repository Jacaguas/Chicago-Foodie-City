                    <!-- Text across the part of the page/container speaking about Portillos -->
                    Jean Banchet is considered the first celebrity chef of the Chicago culinary scene. 
                    However, he is much more than that. Banchet is largely attributed with bringing 
                    Chicago world renown respect in the larger culinary community. The French-born 
                    chef’s famous restaurant, “Le Francais”, spearheaded the ascent from “Steak and 
                    potatoes” region, to recognized contributors to the discipline. It can be argued 
                    that this ascent changed the overall landscape of the business of restaurants at 
                    all levels. To succeed in Chicago’s restaurant scene, there was a standard set and 
                    that had to be met.

                    Many of the well recognized chefs in Chicago today still 
                    use many of the methods, recipes, and approach to the art 
                    that they learned while working under Banchet. In a Chicago Tribune
                    story by Shanzeh Ahmad, established chefs spoke about Banchet's 
                    influence:</br>

                    "'The brioche we make is Jean’s recipe,' she said. 
                    'Everyone still trades that recipe because it’s possibly one 
                    of the best brioche recipes of all time. All my sauces are 
                    based in the principles I learned from Jean. No one cooked 
                    like him.'"

                    <p>
                        The Twinkie was created by James Dewar, a baker, 
                        in 1930. Dewar had a bakery in a suburb of Chicago. 
                        Fun facts are that he named them “Twinkies” after 
                        seeing a billboard that read “Twinkie Toe Shoes”, 
                        and the filling was originally banana crème. 
                        Unfortunately, the famous treat is facing extinction.

                        cafeteria, or home menu for quick dessert came about during 
                        the World’s Fair. A rich man’s wife invented this treat in 
                        her effort to take something different from a cake to the Fair. 
                        However, the name didn’t get attached to her recipe until 1898 
                        when it was referred to as such in a Sears catalog.

                <p>
                    To be clear, gum is a very old invention. It is 
                    pretty ancient…like thousands of years old. However, 
                    that version is not what we all recognize as gum. 
                    The flavorful, chewey, fun thing to chew, Wrigley’s gum, 
                    has its roots to William Wrigley Jr.. After moving to 
                    Chicago just before the start of the 20th century, 
                    Wrigley invented Wrigley’s Spearmint and Juicy Fruit gums. 
                    If you’re wondering, Doublemint gum wasn’t created until 1914. 
                    His imprint on Chicago is very prominent. There is the 
                    Wrigley Building in downtown Chicago, and the famous MLB venue, 
                    Wrigley Field.

            <h1>Nation's Meat Provider</h1>
            <!-- text box related to photo of food on left -->
            <p>
                After the Civil War, Chicago played a pivotal role 
                in more than just the food industry…namely meat packing. 
                Becoming the leader in America in the meatpacking industry 
                came about due to critical factors. Geography (being in the Midwest), 
                railroad system (connected to the entire Midwest and the east coast), 
                farmers, and the major contracts from the Union Army for meat and livestock.                 
            </p>
        </div>

            <h1>Sparked Change</h1>
            <!-- text box related to photo of food on left -->
            <p>
                As one can imagine, the demand generated innovation in 
                meatpacking processes (ability to cool meats) and centers. 
                Chicago was responsible for providing 80% of the nation’s meat. 
                Thus, a major source of employment. Consequently, by the 1920s, labor strife 
                and the development of Unions gave birth to the Labor Rights Movement in the 
                region that all had direct and indirect effect on the nation’s economy 
                and civil rights.

            The founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc, is a native 
            of Chicago and the very first McDonald’s was opened 
            in the Chicago area. The iconic chain is actually 
            headquartered in Chicago’s West Loop area, 
            Fulton Market neighborhood. McDonald’s commitment to Chicago 
            is so great that their total contribution to the area’s economy 
            is said to be more than $2 billion. They invest in community 
            initiatives to fight violence, create employment opportunities, 
            and help people in need.
